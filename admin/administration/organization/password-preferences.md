# Password preferences

Once the preference is set depending upon the set preference, it allows us to create password as per the mentioned conditions. The two preferences are: one is simple but weak and the other is a second preference which is strong. &#x20;

Beginning at the main screen, select **Admin,** then **Organization** from the drop down menu. This will launch the [**Organization**](./) **** menu.

Select **Password Preferences** to set the preferences.
