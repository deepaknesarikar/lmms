# Currency Configuration



As many of the operations within LMS take place on an international scale, a variety of currencies may be used. This section allows an organization to define what currencies will be used throughout their interactions within the LMS system.

From the [Welcome Page](../../../allusers/navigation.md#dashboard), click on the **Admin** button on the top menu bar, then click on **Organization** from the drop down list. This will launch the [**Organization**](./) menu.

Select **Currency Configuration**.
