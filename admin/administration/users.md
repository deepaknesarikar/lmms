# Users

Application **Users** are people who work for your organization and will be using LMS to track all the information about your organization's operations. For example, an accountant working at a branch needs a user account in this application to track all the accounting related tasks and information. Similarly, a branch manager needs a user account to manage his/her client's portfolios.

In this section, you will learn how to add, delete or modify your organizationâ€™s users. These are people with system access working at the offices within your organization. They are subject to different restrictions based on the roles assigned to them (by the system administrator).

Before setting up usernames, the organization should give thought to the standard that will be used throughout the organization. This may be first.lastname; it may be a numerical identifier such as 101lastname (indicating the main office) or 201lastname indicating a branch office.  Whatever the method adopted by your organization, it should be consistently used when creating users.

From the main screen, click on **Admin** then select **Users** from the drop down list.

This will launch the users page that displays a list of Users with their details _(refer to the screenshot below)_ such as:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Office

![](../../.gitbook/assets/userlist.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the **Filter by Name** feature at the top of the screen to avoid scrolling through all the entries. Just begin typing the name you are looking for and LMS will automatically narrow down the search for you.
{% endhint %}

### **Create a User** <a href="#users-createauser" id="users-createauser"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you start to create Users, please ensure that you have created their respective Roles (for more information, see [Manage Roles and Permissions)](system/manage-roles-and-permissions.md).
{% endhint %}

Start this process by clicking on the blue **Create User** button at the top-right corner of the **Users** screen.

You will then be prompted to fill in a series of fields and define the new user's office and role(s), such as:

* Username
* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* Office
* Selected Roles

**NOTE: Fields marked with asterisks ('\*') are mandatory.**

* By default, the **Auto generate password** checkbox will be checked. It will send an auto generated password to the provided Email ID.

{% hint style="info" %}
Auto Generate Password will only work if Email gateway is correctly configured for your tenent
{% endhint %}

* Alternatively, un-checking the box will allow you to provide a password manually. This will give you access to the **Password** and **Repeat Password** fields that allow you to create your own password.
