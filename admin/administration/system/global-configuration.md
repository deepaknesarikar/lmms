# Global Configuration

From here several global settings are defined. These are typically set up at the initial system installation and are rarely changed. &#x20;

Beginning at the main screen, select **Admin**, then **System** from the drop-down menu. This will launch the [**System**](./) menu.

Select **Configurations**.

Once you have selected configurations, LMS will display all Global Configuration options and their current status in a chart:

## Explanation of each global configuration setting

Some global configurations are simply a Boolean setting, specifying if its true (enabled) or false (disabled). Others are numerical settings in which the value corresponds to a month of the year, number of days, etc. Please read the purpose/description closely to understand.&#x20;
