# System

The **System** menu contains links to ten (10) pages. These pages are listed on the right hand side of this page. Each one is designed to help you control the day-to-day operations your organization requires when using LMS.

When getting started with LMS, please refer to the [Initial System Setup](../../initial-system-setup/) page.

Want to learn more about navigation in LMS? See the **General Navigation** section of this manual.

From the Welcome page, click [Administration](../) and choose **System** from the drop down list.
