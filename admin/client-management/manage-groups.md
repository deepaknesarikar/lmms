_**Explanation of how this differs with LMS**_&#x20;

In LMS the concept of the group meeting and its schedule were rigidly constructed that closely affected every aspect of the client, group, center, loan. Being so central, made setting up these meetings very intuitive, but also very difficult and hard to support anything outside of this meeting behavior. The functionality for configuring group meetings is a little hidden in LMS so that's why we need this explanation section.&#x20;
