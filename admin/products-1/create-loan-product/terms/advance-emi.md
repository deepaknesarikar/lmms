# Advance EMI

**EMI** in **advance** (aka **Advance EMI** scheme) is a common feature of car loans offered by most banks in India. In this scheme, you agree to make a payment of one **EMI** in **advance** to the bank. Generally banks deduct this amount from the loan amount disbursed to the car dealer.

You can enable this feature by enabling the Advance EMI flag
