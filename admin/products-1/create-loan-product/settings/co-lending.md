# Co-Lending

By definition, co-lending is when a fintech firm comes together with a traditional lender, to disburse loans. The association allows fintech firms to source clients, perform credit appraisals and disburse a small part of the loan amount

The sharing of the co-lending can be done in any percentage. You can also add multiple partners in co-lending (more than one partner)

**Step1: Create Partners**

You need to create partners by going to Organization >> Manage Partners

Example -&#x20;

If you are giving a loan of 100000 with your part as 80%, then you can enter 80 in **Self Shares** and 20 in Partner shares

If you are charging interest rate of 8% and partner is charge interest rate of 12% then you can give  a loan of 20% nominal interest rate and Self shares of 40 and Partner share of 60 for interest component
