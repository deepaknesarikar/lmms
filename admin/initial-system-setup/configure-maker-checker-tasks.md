# Configure Maker Checker Tasks

Return to the **Admin/System** Screen, then select [**Configure Maker-Checker Tasks** ](../administration/system/configure-maker-checker-tasks.md)(Optional)&#x20;

Maker Checker functionality allows a financial institution to define transactions as having a maker and a checker phase. One user enters, deletes or changes data. Then, another user that has "Checker" rights for that transaction can inspect and approve the data. By default, Maker Checker functionality is disabled. See [Update Global Configuration ](../administration/system/global-configuration.md)to enable/disable Maker Checker functionality at a global level.

Additionally, Maker Checker functionality for each transaction (permission) is disabled by default. see [Enable/Disable Permissions for Maker Checker](../administration/system/configure-maker-checker-tasks.md) to enable/disable Maker Checker functionality at a transaction (permission) level.

Finally, to give checking rights to a user (via a role associated with the user) see[ Update a Role's Permissions. ](../administration/system/manage-roles-and-permissions.md)
