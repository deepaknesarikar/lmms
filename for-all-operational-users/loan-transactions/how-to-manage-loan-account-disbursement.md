## How to Manage Loan Account Disbursement <a href="#title-text" id="title-text"></a>

Loan account applications that have been approved can be disbursed to a negotiable payment type (e.g., Cash, Check, M-Pesa) or to a saving account linked to the loan application. When a loan account is disbursed, its status changes from **Approved** to **Active**.

A disbursement made in error can be undone. When a disbursement is undone, the loan account status changes from **Active** to **Approved**.
