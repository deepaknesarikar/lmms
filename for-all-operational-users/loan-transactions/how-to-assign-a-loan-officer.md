A loan officer may be assigned to loan accounts that are Pending Approval, Approved, or Active. A loan officer may be removed from a loan account and a different loan officer assigned when loan accounts are Pending Approval, Approved, or active.

The status of the loan remains the same when a loan officer is assigned.
