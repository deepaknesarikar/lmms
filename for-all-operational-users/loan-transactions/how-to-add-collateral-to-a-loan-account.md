## How to Add Collateral to a Loan Account <a href="#title-text" id="title-text"></a>

One or more collateral items can be added to a loan account application. Collateral can be added to loan accounts in the following ways:&#x20;

* Collateral items can be selected and attached to the loan account application when the loan account application is being created.
* Collateral items can be selected and attached to the loan account application by modifying a loan account application in Pending Approval status.
* Collateral items can be selected and attached when viewing the loan account application by clicking Add Collateral from the More menu on the action bar (the Add Collateral option is available when the status of the loan account application is Pending Approval).

Adding a collateral item to a loan account application does not affect the loan account application's status.
