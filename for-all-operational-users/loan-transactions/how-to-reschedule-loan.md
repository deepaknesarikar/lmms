## How to reschedule loan <a href="#title-text" id="title-text"></a>

Rescheduling and Restructuring loans has been a feature in high demand and will allow financial institutions to better manage their portfolio in arrears by giving their clients flexible options to maximize the possibility of recovery.

Thanks to the Musoni team for contributing the code-level changes to the LMS platform to support loan rescheduling.

Four different scenarios to reschedule or refinance loans are now supported. One or all of the adjustments can be applied to a single loan.
