# How to Add a Charge to a Loan Account

## How to Add a Charge to a Loan Account <a href="#title-text" id="title-text"></a>

Charges (fees and penalties) can be charged to loan accounts in three ways:&#x20;

* Charges are inherited from the product definition. A loan officer may have the ability to remove one or more of these charges from a loan account. When a charge is removed from a loan account, other loan accounts are not affected.
* Charges (not yet associated with the loan account) can be selected and attached to the loan account.
* Miscellaneous charges (one time charge) can be charged to a loan account. The loan officer specifies the amount, which is added in the next payment.

Charges may be added at the time of loan account application and when a loan account is Pending Approval, Approved, and Active. Adding a charge to a loan account does not affect the loan account's status.
