## How to Waive Interest for a Loan Account <a href="#title-text" id="title-text"></a>

To waive interest for a loan account, a LMS user must be granted permission to do so.

The amount of interest to be waived can be specified when completing the transaction. The amount will default to interest amounts that are in arrears on the transaction date if any, or the total interest payable on the loan if interest is not in arrears.

Before waiving interest, review the information on the loan account summary tab to confirm the amount of interest to be waived.
