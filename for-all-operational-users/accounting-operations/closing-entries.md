# Closing Entries

## Closing Entries <a href="#title-text" id="title-text"></a>

In LMS, you can close accounting to journal entries. Closures can be applied to all branches or to each branch separately.

It is important for organizations to close accounting periodically to prevent transactions that affect the accounting books.

If you make a transaction before the closing date, you will receive an error. If you need to backdate a transaction to a date before the closure date, you must first delete the closure.
