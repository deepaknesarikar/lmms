# Frequent Postings

## Frequent Postings <a href="#title-text" id="title-text"></a>

Frequent Postings is an integral feature that ease an accountant's tasks and aid in reducing errors. They rely on pre-configured Accounting Rules, and thus the accounting transactions involving debit/credit accounts are predefined too.

This enables users with non-accountant roles to do transactions. By simply selecting an accountant rule and providing the transaction details, one can perform a transaction.
