## What Is a Bank Reconciliation Statement?

A bank reconciliation statement is a summary of banking and business activity that reconciles an entityâ€™s bank account with its financial records. The statement outlines the deposits, withdrawals and other activities affecting a bank account for a specific period. A bank reconciliation statement is a useful financial internal control tool used to thwart fraud.
