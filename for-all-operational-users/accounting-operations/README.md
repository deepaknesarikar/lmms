# Accounting Operations

## Add journal Entries

**Journal Entries** are essentially logs of all the transactions in your organization that have accounting implications.

LMS logs some transactions automatically, such as the ones associated to the products linked with **General Ledger (GL)** accounts. Other miscellaneous transactions need to be entered manually by the users.

### **Manual Journal Entries vs. Automated Portfolio Postings** <a href="#addjournalentries-manualjournalentriesvs.automatedportfoliopostings" id="addjournalentries-manualjournalentriesvs.automatedportfoliopostings"></a>

In LMS, the majority of accounting entries occur automatically based on your loan and savings product-level settings configured in [Product Creation and Configuration](https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/display/docs/Product+Creation+and+Configuration). For more information, see [Loan Integration with Accounting](https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/display/MIFOSX/Loan+Integration+With+Accounting).

LMS also supports manual entries against any General Ledger (GL) account. You can manually post single journal entries or compound journal entries, the steps for which are detailed in subsequent sections.
